## What is Bash?

Bash is a command line interpreter. It is a program that takes commands from the
keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. Bash is an acronym
for Bourne Again SHell, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct
ancestor of the current Unix shell sh. The name is a reference to the fact that
Bourne's shell was the direct ancestor of the Bourne Again SHell. The version of
Bash included with OS X is actually a version of the GNU Project's Bourne Again
SHell, or bash, which is a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. The
GNU Project is a free software organization founded in 1983 to develop the GNU
operating system and its GNU/Linux variants.

Note: all the documentation for now is done for MacOS. Linux/Windows could be a
little different (feel free to open a PR). But, in a terminal session, you can
type `man <command>` to get the manual for the command.
